const duke = `I’m nobly ranked but not a king,
Between the crown and knight, I swing.
In courts I stood with stately grace,
With lands and titles to embrace.
A fighter too, in battles bleak—

What title is it that you seek?`

const dancer = `I move with grace but speak no word,
My voice is in the steps you've heard.
On stage I spin, in rhythm's trance,
A silent art, a fleeting dance.
With pointed toes or tapping feet,
I make the music feel complete.

Who am I?`

const gummy = `On special days, we love to appear,
In bags or bowls, we bring good cheer.
We're guests at parties, never late,
Lined up beside the birthday cake.
No claws, no growls, yet shaped like beasts,
We're chewy, sweet, and tiny treats.
We’re not for hugs, though we wear grins—
Find us where the fun begins!

What are we?`

const closet = `I dwell within your quiet walls,
A sentry still in shadowed halls.
I guard what’s hung but do not speak,
A place the curious rarely seek.
Behind me lies both neat and lost,
A world unseen at little cost.
Reveal me with a simple twist,
I vanish when I don’t exist.

What am I?`
